#The Frog Game\
\
For my game, I was inspired by Nintendogs. I want to create a cute simulator where you get to choose from a selection of different frogs and have the ability to customize them and take care of them. The primary goal is to take care of your frog(s) and make sure they stay well fed and happy.\
\
The setting will be a pond decorated with lily pads and flies. The frogs will have a meter that measures their energy, hunger, social, and hygiene. You will have the ability to manipulate aspects of the game in order to maintain the frog\'92s overall happiness meter. \
\
I will need to pull models from google poly, implement raycasting, and meters. }
