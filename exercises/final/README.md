##CSC470 Final Project: Prison Break

#Game Plan:
 - Story/Theme: This game will not feature a third-person player and rather the camera will act as the player, and make it so that you are playing in first person. Your initial setup is a prison cell, and there will be objects that will give you hints and help you break out of your cell. 
 - Gameplay Description: Clicking on the different objects surrounding you will help you find clues to move forward and find the key to breaking out of your cell. From there, you will wander throughout the prison, hiding from guards, and continuing to look for the key objects you need to break free.
 - Input: The user will use arrow keys and the mouse to interact

#Visual Style:
- The style of this game will be dark and sort of dull in color scheme in order to fit the aesthetic of a maximum security prison. 
- The outline of the clickable objects will be orange to compliment and contrast the dull grayscale-esque theme of the game.

#Audio Style:
- The background music will be slow and ominous, slowly ramping up as the player gets closer to escaping prison.

#Interface Sketch:
- The UI will utilize clicking and the arrow/WASD keys to move the player. 
- There will be a meter measuring progress in the game, that will either go up or down depending on the amount of objects collected or how close the guards get to the player.

##Goals of the Project:

#The Low-Bar:
- The low bar would be that the prison will be reduced to just the cell and the goal would be breaking out of the cell. There would be less clickable objects and no guards. The meter would simply measure if you have collected the correct objects.

#Target Goal:
- The target goal is what I have outlined: The POV Prison Break game wherein you are moving around a prison cell and prison and then clicking on highlighted objects and avoiding guards.

#The High-Bar:
- The high bar would involve many clickable objects and more interactivity between the player and the guards.

##Timeline Needed:
- There are about 3 weeks until this is due. I will need to be working pretty hard consistently in order to pump out the project by the due date and in a way that I am proud of my product.
